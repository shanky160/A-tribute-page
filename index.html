        <h2>Babbage's Life</h2>
        <p>He was the son of Benjamin Babbage, who was a wealthy man. Because his father was so wealthy, Charles was able to receive a wonderful education at very advanced and “elite” schools. He had to move to a “country school” when he was 8 because he needed to recover from a dangerous fever. He also attended King Edward VI Grammar school in Totnes, South Devon. Because of his health, he had to transfer back to private teaching. But then joined a 30-student “closed academy” which was “managed” by Reverend Stephen Freeman. Here, Babbage would study mathematics. He had two private tutors…one was a “clergyman” from Cambridge and another was and Oxford tutor who taught Babbage Classics, so he could be accepted into Cambridge. He was disappointed in the math programs at Cambridge, so he, along with friends of his, decided to form the Analytical Society in 1820.</p>

      <h2>His Inventions</h2>
      <h6>Babbage drew up plans for three main computing systems in his life.</h6>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Difference Engine:</strong>  The Difference Engine was the first of Babbage's inventions. He designed it in the 1820s and then built it with funding he obtained. The name comes from the method of divided differences which is used to interpolate or tabulate functions by using a small set of polynomial coefficients.</li>
        <li><strong>Difference Engine 2:</strong>   The Difference Engine 2 was the second of Babbage's inventions. Babbage designed this mechanical computing engine but did not live to see one built.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytical Engine:</strong>   Babbage's Analytical Engine was a design that was undertaken to create a mechanical general-purpose computer. Babbage first mentioned the Analytical Engine in 1837 and it was the successor to his difference engine. The Analytical Engine incorporated all the elements of a modern day computer: an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory. The programming was to be undertaken using punched cards. Ada Lovelace wrote instructions for it, although she was never able to implement them because Babbage did not succeed in realising it is a real form. However the fact that she wrote a programme for it made her the first computer programmer.</li>
